      <div class="description">
        <p>We're here to help with that! Our website features many different resources, including:
          <br>exercise videos, breathing exercises, a wellness check in, and a graph displaying emotions.</br></p>

      <p>Wellness Check Ins (Completed On A Daily Basis) are extremely useful to track emotions and moods. <br>If any responses are concerning, users will be directed to the national helpline to gain access to help.</br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="homedescription">
      <p>The Emotion Tracker functions as a way for people to keep track of their moods on an hourly/daily basis. This is more short term, as opposed to the wellness check-ins. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homedescription">
      <p>The positive quotes serve as a way for people to stay motivated and keep up with their daily tasks. Additionally, they can add some of their own favorite quotes if they want to. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homedescription">
      <p>The "track your goals" section allows users to input different goals they have for themselves (whether they be long term or short term). Overall, it is meant to inspire productivity and keep the mind free. </p>
    </div>
  <div class="homedescription">
      <p>The "calendar" section allows users to add in certain events they want to keep track of (this could be for doctor's appointments, school events, etc.). Anything is possible! </p>
